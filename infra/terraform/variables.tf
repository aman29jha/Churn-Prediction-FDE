Bumped to sha-1633705-amd64: fixed a critical, hours-long-silent bug — live ingest events were written to bronze/live/ (a subdirectory), and Spark's directory JSON reader never descends into subdirectories by default, so silver_transform kept 'succeeding' every run while never once seeing a live event.
